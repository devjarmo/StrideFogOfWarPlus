*** Research ***
0) Create a new camera to render the default terrain.
	- Should be the first camera, render to texture. - Group 1 only.
		- Change all the other players to group 15.
	- Next should be the normal camera. - All groups minus 31.
	- Final can be the fog camera.
	- Will the FogOfWar need set in it's own render pass for drawing? - To remove players?
6) Remove the material from the current fog of war.
7) Begin writing shader.
8) Can I interpolate between shader values to smooth everything out? If there is any green, interpolate from the last value.
	- Test this.
8) Turn back on post effects for the normal camera, for nice looking spheres.
